## My Review:

It was okay. The instructor moves quickly over a couple times and while some of the earlier excercises were essentially copies of the lectures (a good thing, imo, for those learning), the later ones assumed you would connect some functions or practices that were a bit off the beaten path. 

That's not necessarily a bad thing, and while Google ended up helping me solving all the excercises and milestones, I sometimes found myself struggling to grasp a concept that wasn't easily answered in a forum post or subsequent lecture. 

A few videos should be re-done for 2021 and I thought the second half of the course - ways to apply what was taught - was smart and generalized for a wider audience. 

Overall, a good way to get your feet wet and I found myself reviewing other's code and understanding it thanks to this course. But I would think about what you want to do with Python and sign up for a course for after this one that drills into how you want to apply Python (CircuitPython, Data Science, Automation, Machine Learning, Games and DIY, etc.)

Contact me with any questions! 

Certificate of completion. Not that it means much. ðŸ™ƒ
